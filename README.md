Edward v. Canada (1929), more commonly known as the Persons Case, is often celebrated as a victory for women’s rights in Canada. However, it is important to understand that at the time of the case only specific women considered citizens and, in some cases, of specific socio-economic and ethnic background, such as women of Northwestern European lineage, despite the common assumption that it applied for all women. Through observations in lectures and western academia there is an apparent trend to present the case as if it included all women when it only included white women. My research aims to present the reality of the persons case through an intersectional lens highlighting how it benefited white women failing to account for Indigenous, black, racialized women who remained legally excluded. Additionally, I aim to provide a comparative view on the Canada’s famous five with the indigenous Five with the hopes to emphasize the need for more inclusive historical and legal discourse.
